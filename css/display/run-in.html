    if an element generates a run-in box, and a block box
follows that box, then the run-in element will be an inline box at the
beginning of the block box.

    The important thing to remember is that  run-in will work only if the box
after the run-in box is block-level. If it is not, then the run-in box itself will
be made block-level.

<h3 style="display:run-in; border: 1px dotted; font-size: 125%;
font-weight: bold;">Run-in Elements</h3>
<p style="border-top: 1px solid black; padding-top: 0.5em;">
    Another interesting block/inline hybrid is the value <code>run-in</code>
    introduced in CSS2, which has the ability to take block-level elements
    them an inline part of a following element. This is useful for certain
    effects that are quite common in print typography, where a heading
    as part of a paragraph of text.
