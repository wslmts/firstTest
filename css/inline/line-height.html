    Thus, for each piece of text where both the  font-size and  line-height are
12px , the content height does not change (since the difference between  12px
and  12px is zero), so the inline box is 12 pixels high. For the strong text,
however, the difference between  line-height and  font-size is  -12px . This
is divided in half to determine the half-leading ( -6px ), and the half-leading is
added to both the top and bottom of the content height to arrive at an inline
box. Since we’re adding a negative number in both cases, the inline box ends
up being 12 pixels tall. The 12-pixel inline box is centered vertically within
the 24-pixel content height of the element, so the inline box is actually
smaller than the content area.
    The anonymous text’s inline box determines the bottom of the line box, while the top of the
strong element’s inline box sets the top of the line box. Because that inline
box’s top is inside the element’s content area, the contents of the element
spill outside the line box and actually overlap other line boxes. The result is
that the lines of text look irregular.

<pre>Since the  line-height for the “tall” text is less than its  font-size , the inline
box for that element is smaller than its content area. This tiny fact changes
the placement of the text itself since the top of its inline box must be aligned
with the top of the line box for its line</pre>
