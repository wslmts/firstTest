      In CSS, you can set both the foreground and background colors of any
      element. In order to understand how this works, it’s important to understand
      what’s in the foreground of an element and what isn’t. Generally speaking,
      it’s the text of an element, although the foreground also includes the borders
      around the element. Thus, there are two ways to directly affect the foreground
      color of an element: by using the  color property, and by setting the border
      colors using one of a number of border properties.
