     For example, if you have a  transition-delay of  -150ms on a  200ms
     transition, the transition will start three-quarters of the way through the
     transition and will last 50 milliseconds. In that scenario, with a linear timing
     function, it will jump to being translated  150px along the x-axis immediately
     on hover and then animate the translation from 150 pixels to 200 pixels over
     50 milliseconds.

     If the absolute value of the negative  transition-delay is greater than or equal to the  transition-duration , the change of property values is
     immediate, as if no  transition had been applied, and no  transitionend
     event occurs.

     When transitioning back from the hovered state to the original state, by
     default, the same value for the  transition-delay is applied. In the preceding
     scenario, with the  transition-delay not being overridden in the hover state,
     it will jump 75% of the way back (or 25% of the way through the original
     transition) and then transition back to the initial state. On mouseout, it will
     jump to being translated 50 pixels along the x-axis and then take 50
     milliseconds to return to its initial position of being translated 0 pixels along
     the x-axis.
